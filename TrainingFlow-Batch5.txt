TypeScript
	- What is TypeScript?
		- Is a superset of JavaScript
		- It is compiled language 
		- It is typesafe
		- Fully compatible to ES6 features.
		- File extension is .ts
		- When compiled using 'tsc' it generate the JS files.
		- Control the compiler configurations using tsconfig.json

			- set whether source map file is required or not.
		- Install typescript globally
			npm install -g typescript
		
	- Module
		- A typescript file that contains a set of exported members
		- A exported member can be class, interface, function, constant.
		- Export the members using export keyword and import them into 
			another module using import keyword.
		- Barrel is a way of importing modules into another files.
		- A barrel use an index.ts file that exports a set of modules from a directory
		and it can be imported using a single line. 
	
Angular
	- What is SPA?
	- How It works?
	- Angular Cli
		- npm install -g @angular/cli
		- ng --version
		- Use to create, test, run , build and deploy the project.
	- Create the project
		ng new <project-name>
	- Angular module	
		- it encapsulates the 
			- components - UI for the application 
				- home.component.ts
				- home.component.html
				- home.component.css
				- home.component.spec.ts
			- directives
				- Used to add/remove behaviour of a DOM element.
				- Used to change the appearance 
			- pipes
				- Used to format the data while printing in template file. 
			- services
				- These are injectable objects (Angular DI sytem creates and manages the service object)
				- Reuable function codes.
			- import submodules(builtin/custom)
		- A module is a typescript class decorated with @NgModule()
	- Run the application
		ng serve -o 
		ng s -o
	- Creating components
		ng generate component <components/nameofcomponent>
		ng g c components/home
	- Directives
		- Structural directives
			- starts with a * symbol.
			- *ngFor, *ngIf, *ngSwitch
		- Attribute directives
		- Components
		
	- Bindings
		- Interpolation - {{variable}}
		- Property binding - input binding - []
			eg: [value]="variable"
		- Event binding - Output binding - ()
			eg: (click)="show()"
		- Two way binding -  [( )]
	- Pipes
		- Pipes are used for formating data in templates.
		- pipes are applied using the pipe symbol - |
		- Left side of the pipesymbol is the input value (Arg) for the pipe function.
			eg: {{ value|pipename[:args] }}
			eg: {{ name|uppercase}}
				{{ today|date:'dd-MMM-yyyy'}}
				{{ salary|currency:'INR':true:'5.2-3'}}
		- Built-in pipes
			- uppercase
			- lowercase
			- titlecase
			- json
			- number
			- currency
			- date
			- async
		- Custom pipes
			- ng generate pipe [pipes/pipename]
			- ng g p [pipes/pipename]
		- Create project	
			ng new <projectname> [options]
			ng new eshop-spa --minimal --skip-tests
		- Create models
			ng g interface models/product
			ng g interface models/category
		- Create services
			ng generate service services/servciename
			ng g s services/product
				- product.service.ts
			- Services can be registered glboally and locally.
			- Register globally in AppModule provider section. 
	
	- Observables and Promises
		- Used for Asynchronous programming.
		- Promises	
			- It is a builtin feature of JavaScript
			- USes request-response pattern			
		- Observables
			- Used for real-time data updations
			- follows publish subscribe pattern
			- Subscribe for the data once and it updates the changes utill you unsubscribe.
			- Need to use RxJs library (ReactiveX ) 
			
	- Forms in Angular
		- Two approaches for form creation: Template driven forms and Reactive Forms
		- You can do Forms validation and submission.
		- Template driven forms
			- Import FormsModule into AppModule from '@angular/forms' package.
			- We use HTML 5 valdiation attributes.
			- Need to use ngModel directive for two way data binding.
			- Every form control must have a name attribute if we use ngModel 
			- A reference variable can also be used to access the form control.
			- Every control have some properties that defines the state.
				valid - invalid
				dirty - pristine
				touched - untouched
			- Forms also have valid and invalid properties.
		- Reactive Forms
			- We use ReactiveFormsModule from '@angular/forms'
			- We use services like FormBuilder to create a FormGroup
			- A formGroup is a class used to create model for the form.
			- We need to use the directives like formGroup and formControlName
			- Valdiations are done in the model object (FormGroup) using Valdiations class.
			- Form and control properties are applicable here also.
Json Server
	- npm install -g json-server
	- json-server --port 3400 --watch eshop.json
	
Http Services
	- We need to use the HttpClientModule that provides the HttpClient service.
	- HttpClientModule is provided by @angular/common/http package.
	- It allows you to connect and fetch data from backend API server.
	- It provides GET, POST, PUT, DELETE ad PATCH methods
	- These methods are generic methods and it returns observable objects
	
Lazy Loading

	ng generate module customers --route customer-route --module app.module
	
	ng g c customers/components/profile
	
	ng g c customers/components/orders
	
		http://localhost:4200/customers  -> Home page of customer
		http://localhost:4200/customers/profile  -> Profile page of customer
		http://localhost:4200/customers/orders
	
MongoDB
-----------

	- mongodb://[hostname/ipaddress]:27017
	- mongodb://localhost:27017
	
	Relational Db vs NoSQL
	database 	- database
	Table		- Collection/Container
	Row			- Document
	Columns		- Attributes
	- Every mongodb document have a unique identifier with the name _id.
	- A unique identifier is a GUID objectId.
	- MongoDB aggregation
		- Combine data from multiple documents.
		- 3 types of aggregation
			- Single purpose aggregation functions.
				count()
				distinct()
			- Aggregation pipeline.
				- An array of operation that executes one after another.
				- Result of one operation is the input of next operation.
				- We use operators like $match, $project, $group, $sort, $unwind etc

Services
	- Services are reusable codes in an application.
	- Services need to be registed in ConfigureServices method of Startup class.
	- .NET Core DI System creates and inject the instance of a service whereever is required.
	- IoC container will take care of the object life time and scope.
	- Services are registered in the ServicesCollection object (services)
	- Services can be registered with the following scopes and life time:
		- Singleton
			- A single instance of service is created and maintained till the end of application.
			- services.AddSingleton() method to register a service as singleton.
		- Scoped
			- A single instance per request scope.			
		- Transient
			- It creates a new instance everytime whereever it is requested.
			- Short lived objects.
	- Builtin DI system can be replaced by third party IoC containers (eg: Autofac)

Configuration Sources
	- Configuration means the parameters passed to the application for exectuion.
	- Such as application settings, Connection Strings etc
	- Passed as Key-Value pair format.
	- We have many configuration sources in .NET Core App:
		- Command Line Args
		- Environment variables
		- In-Memory collections
		- AppSettings.json (JSON files)
		- XML files
		- INI files
		- Key Per File 
		- Azure Key Vault
	- When the Default WebHost Builder created a Web Host, it comes with some preconfigured
	 configuration sources such as Cmd Line args, Env variables and Appsettings.json.

Caching

Statemanagement
	- Query Strings
	- Hidden fields
	- Cookies
	- TempData
	- Session
	- DI
	- Cache
	- HttpContext.Items
	
.NET Core App Deployment Types
	- FDD - Framework Dependent Deployment.
		- dotnet app.dll
		- Shared libraries and framework are not part of app deployment.
		- Runtime must be installed in machine
		- Application can be run using "dotnet myapp.dll" command
	- SCD - Self-Contained Deployment
		- Runtime is also published into the deployment folder.
		- No runtime required in the machine. 
		- Specify the RID in the .csproj file.
			<RuntimeIdentifiers>win10-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
		- Publish using the following command.
			syntax: dotnet publish -c Release -r <rid-value>
			example: dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64
	- FDE - Framework Dependent Executables
		- Shared libraries and framework are not part of app deployment.
		- Runtime must be installed in machine
		- It creates a self executable exe file in the publish folder. 
		- It can be run directly by command prompt or double click.
		
Entity Framework Core	
	- Entity classes and DbContext class.
	- Configure the DbContext Service in ConfigureServices method.
	- For production we use SqlServer as database.
	- Database sources:
		- In-memory
		- SqlServer
	- Microsoft.EntityframeworkCore namespace.
	
---------------------------------------------------

Developing Microservices
----------------------
	- What is monolithic architecture?
		- All application modules are part of single project
		- Features:	
			- Old and easy approaches
			- No headache of implementing communication
			- Easy to deploy and develop.
			- Tightly coupled
			- Choice of languages and frameworks are less.
			- Every time we need to redeploy the app when a change comes in any one module.
			- Scaling of individual modules not possible.
			- limitted/complex polyglot persistance
		- SOA 
			- Create each module of app is created as individually deployable projects
			- We use a communication channel which is used by all modules. 
				- ESB - Enterprise Service Bus (ESB Mule)
			- All modules shares a common database.
			
		- Microservices
			- Indivually developed, tested and deployed.
			- They never share the database.
			- Any service can communicate to any other service directly.
			- Every service is exposing a well defiened end point - REST endpoint
			- Communication pattersns:
				- HTTP based - REST
				- Message based - Queues
	- Microservices 
		- Communication patterns:
			- REST based (HTTP)
				- Nearly Real time 
				- Synchrnous in nature
				- One to one communication.
				- For every request there is a response received.
			- Queue based
				- Not real time communication.
				- Asynchronous in nature.
				- One to many and one to one are supported
				- No response required for message based 
			- Event Based
				- Nearly real time 
				- Asynchronous
				- One way communication
				- No response received .
				- One or more event handlers can catch the event data.
		- Choice of languages and frameworks
		- Database not shared 
		- Independetly developed, deployed and tested.
		- Independetly scalable services.
	- .NET Core Web API	
		- Every controller is inheriting from ControllerBase
		- ControllerBase is a base class for MVC controller and Web API controller
		- Every controller is decorated with [ApiController] attribute.
		- No RoutePrefix for controller, Route() is used instead for defining prefix.
		- No Route() attribute required for action, Http Method selector attribute
		can define the template and Route name.
		- Method return type:
			- Void 
			- Specific types such as string, boolen, integer etc
			- HttpResponseMessage
			- ActionResult<T> - Recommended
			
	- CORS Policies
		- Cross Origin Resource Sharing 
		- Defines a set of rules that tells the API to allow certain domain, methods and headers.		
	- Open API Documentation
		- For Web services we get service documentation using WSDL file.
		- For RESTful services we can use Open API specification doc (Swagger doc).
		- We can use Swashbucle.AspNetCore package to configure the Swagger Doc.
		
	- Enable Xml serializer
		- Use the AddXmlDataContactSerilizerFormatters() method with services.AddMvc()		
	- Authentication for Web API
		- No Login GUI is provided for APIs
		- Use tokens for authentication. (OAuth Token, JWT Token)
		- A token is an encrypted text that contains the audience (api), issuer(identity provider), 
		  claims (roles and other info), expiry time, Algorithm and secret code 
	- Custom formatters
	
RabbitMQ
	- Communication patterns:
		- RESTful services - Synchrnous
		- Message Based - Asynchronous, one to Many, Not real-time
		- Event driven architecture - Asynchronous, one to many, real-time
		
	- Messaging
		- Two applications can communicate asynchronously.
		- A small text message is sent to a Message Broker. 
		- A message broker is an agent that provides message based communication.
			- Features:
				- Provides storage for messages.
				- Different message delivery patterns 
					- Direct - One to one
					- Topic - Pattern based (multicast)
					- Fanout - Broadcasting to everyone
				- Deliver message when recepient comes online.
				- TTL - Time to Live - Undelivered messages can be moved to Dead letter queue.
		- Azure Servcie Bus, Azure Storage Queue, RabbitMQ 		
		rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
		
Docker
	- Images and containers
		- Containerized application is called image.
		- Image is used to create instances of application
		- the running instance is called container.
		- Every container have a unique name and ID
		- Every image also have unique name and ID
		- Image name must be in <imagename>:<tag> format
			- Tag is a version identifier or unique value that can be used to identify image.
			eg: eshop-web:1.0
				eshop-web:2.2
				eshop-web:3.0
		- If tag name is not supplied at the time of image creation, it will be assigned 
			to 'latest' by default.
			eg: eshop-web:latest
		- An image contains a set of layers.
			Every layer has unique iD
	- Repositories (registries)
		- Is a storage place for code and data.
		- A docker image repository is a place to store images.
		- Repositories can be:
			Local
				- Store locally in Dev machine.
				- Local repo images name can be anything, without repo name
				- local image=> calculator:latest
			Cloud 
				- Publiclly accessible repository.
				- Anyone can access it from here.
				- Two types:
					- Public 
						- When uploading into a public repo it is accessible to all without any credentials.
						- DockerHub is an example for Public repo
						- sonusathyadas/calculator:latest is uploaded by sonusathyadas
						- chandan/calculator:latest uploaded by chandan.
						= docker pull sonusathyadas/calculator:latest
					- Private
						- Secured repository
						- It needs credentials to push and pull images.
						- Azure Container Registry (ACR), Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
	
			
	- Docker commands
		docker images
	- List all images located in local repo
	
	docker run -p host-port:container-port -d --name nameofcontainer --rm imagename
	- --name = used to assign a name for the running container. If not used docker will asign
	a random name to the container.
	- -d = detached mode. 
	- --rm = remove the container when stoped.
	- -p  = map host machine port number to container app port.
	
	docker ps
		List all running containers
	
	docker stop <containerID/container name>
		- STop a running container
	
	docker ps -a
		- List all running and stopped containers
	
	docker rm <containerID/name>
		- Remove the stopped containers
	
	docker rm -f <containerID/name>
		- Stop and remove running containers

	Building images
		- A set of commands need to be executed
		- Commands can be written into a fiel called "Dockerfile"
		- The instruction to build an image may start with the following keywords:
			- FROM <baseimagename>
				- Specify the base image for our application.
				- eg: FROM nginx:latest
				
			- LABEL <key>=<value>
				- USed to add meta information for image, such as author info, version, company etc
				- LABEL author "Sonu Sathyadas"
				- LABEL version 1.2.0
			
			- RUN <cmd> <args>
				- Execute a command while building the image. 
				- RUN dotnet restore && dotnet build && dotnet publish 
			- WORKDIR <dir_path>
				- Set the curret working directory inside the container.
				= WORKDIR /usr/app
				- WORKDIR C:\Users\myapp
				
			- COPY [-from <stage>]<source files/pattern> <dest_path>
				- Copy files from local machine to docker image path.
				- COPY ./*.jpg  /usr/app/		
				
			- ENV <envvariablename> <value>
				- Used to set the environment variable value for the app.
				
			- EXPOSE <port-number>
				- Specify the port number to opened
				
			- CMD <command> <args>
				- Execute commands when the container is created.
				- When image is running.
				
			- ENTRYPOINT <cmd> <args>
				- Execute commands when the container is created.
				- When image is running.
				- It is used to specify the starting command of application. 
			
	- Building docker images
		- docker build -t <imagename:tag> <dockerfilepath>
		
	- Containerizing .NET Core apps
		- Download SDK and runtime images
			docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2.7-bionic
			docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2.402-bionic
		
	- Remove docker images
		docker rmi <imageid/name> 
		docker rmi [-f] <imageid/name>
		

On-premise 
	- Infrastructure cost - Compute, storage and network
	- scaling
		- Scale up - increase the size of existing instance.
		- Scale out - increase the number of instances
	- backup
		- Explicit backup policies need tobe implemented.
	- Security
		- Security for application and network need to be configured explicitly.
	- monitoring 
		- configure monitoring services
	- complaince to specifications

Cloud
	- No need to buy infrastructure - No Infra Cost.
	- Scaling of app instances happens quickly.
	- Backup - Inbuilt backup policies implemented.
	- All levels security is enabled
	- Monitoing is by default enabled.
	- complaince - All kinds of apps can be deployed.
	- Pay As you Go Model
	- New frameworks and technologies are adopted .
	
Type of Clouds
	- Private cloud
		- Cloud infrastructure for a single customer.
		- Cloud vendor provide service only for a single customer.		
	- Public Cloud
		- Any body can register and create an account.
		- You can buy the subscription and start creating services.
		- Multiple users share the same infrastructure.
		- Cheaper compared to PRivate cloud.
	- Hybrid cloud
		- Combination of public and private cloud.
		
Cloud Models
	- Cloud services include DB services, compute services, messaging services, serverless servcies
		Storage services, Identity services, AI services, analytics servies and more
	
	- Three cloud service models
		- IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
			- Cloud vendor offers infra services like compute (CPU, RAM), Storage, Network 
			- You can set up your own app infrastructure using the IaaS servcies.
			- This services are used by Admins (IT Pros)
		- PaaS - Platform as a Service
